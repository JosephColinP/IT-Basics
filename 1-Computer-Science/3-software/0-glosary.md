# Glossary



**Algorithm** 
An algorithm is just a series of steps that solves specific problems.

**Cryptography**
Cryptography is the art of writing and solving codes.

**Coding**
Translate something from one language into another.

**Scripts**
mainly used to perform a single or limited range of task.

**Programing**
coding in a programing language.

**Programming languages** 
special languages that software developers use to write instructions for cumputers to execute.

**Assembly Language**
Allowed computer scientist to use human readable instructions, assembled into code, that the machines could understand.

**Compiled programming languages**
Uses human readeble instructions, then sends them through a compiler.  The compiler takes the human instructions and compiles them into machine instructions. Compilers are a key component to programming.

**Interpreted language**
Interpreted languages aren't compiled ahead of time. A file that has code written in one of these languages is usually called a Script. The script is run by an interpreter, which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them.



### Device drivers

In computing, a device driver is a computer program that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer or automaton.

The main purpose of device drivers is to provide abstraction by acting as a translator between a hardware device and the applications or operating systems that use it

Los drivers son programas añadidos al núcleo del sistema operativo, estos tienen acceso sin restricciones a todo el equipo, resulta esencial que sólo se permitan los controladores de dispositivos autorizados.



### BIOS

BIOS is firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs.

The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first software to run when powered on. 

The BIOS in modern PCs initializes and tests the system hardware components (Power-on self-test), and loads a boot loader from a mass storage device which then initializes an operating system. 

​          

#### Boot Process

it means to start from nothing and follow a series of steps to arrive at a fully operational system.



#### Boot Order

1- Power On
2- BIOS/UEFI initializes our computer's hardware to make sure everything is good to go.
3- BIOS/UEFI runs POST test.
4- POST performs a series of diagnostic test to make sure that the computer is in proper working order.
5- Boot device selection. This boot device could be USB, CD, Harddrives, etc.
6- Runs the "Bootloader" is a program that loads the operating system.
7-  The bootloader loads the OS and the OS  the Kernel and then the Pheriferials and essential system procceses.
8- Finally the user can interact with the machine.



### Firmware

Firmware is just a special kind of software that serves a very narrow purpose for a piece of hardware. While you might install and uninstall software on your computer or smartphone on a regular basis, you might only rarely, if ever, update the firmware on a device and you'd probably only do so if asked to by the manufacturer, probably to fix a problem.

*firmware* is everywhere—on your smartphone, your PC's motherboard, even your TV remote control. You can think of firmware simply as "software for hardware".

firmware is a specific class of computer software that provides the low-level control for a device's specific hardware. 

Firmware, such as the BIOS of a personal computer, may contain basic functions of a device, and may provide hardware abstraction services to higher-level software such as operating systems. For less complex devices, firmware may act as the device's complete operating system, performing all control, monitoring and data manipulation functions.
